# Legere Librum Project

Legere Librum is a project built for the [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) that allows you to search for and select books from a [provided API](BooksAPI.js), storing them into one of three categories:


- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read


The goal of the project is to demonstrate an understanding of the fundamentals of React by building a React-based SPA (single-page application).

## Getting Started

This project requires Node.js. If you do not have it installed on your machine you can find it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Dependencies and Usage

git clone the project and cd into it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bantabanta/legere-librum.git
cd legere-librum
```

Install npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the app in development mode:
```bash
npm start
```

You should now see the interactive webapp in your browser. If you don't, simply navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000).

### Note*

The API accepts a limited number of search queries. Don't be suprised if your query returns no results despite having searched for a specific author or title!

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/packages/cra-template/template/README.md).

## Starter Code

As the goal of this project was to gain a better understanding of React, some starter code was used. For more information see [UDACITY.md](UDACITY.md).
